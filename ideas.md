This document provides a way for me to extend Coffeebot without actually extending Coffeebot. Instead it shows me all the ways I should design coffeebot to accomodate for all these ideas down the line.

# Statistics on collectives
This is a little silly. But when each collective is spawned and the maker decided, that might be convenient history for people interested in when they have their coffee. Representations could be in lined, but that's a little hard work, unless I generate them through coffeebot and zulip has an image upload API. This would also require a database and file access, which would necessitate a user.
